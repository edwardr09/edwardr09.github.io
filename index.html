    <h2><a href="video.html">Unit 2</a></h2>
    <p id="overview"> <img src="http://dailydropcap.com/images/I-12-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" align="left" alt="I"/>n Unit 2, I learned how to create my webpage using HTML code. Learning HTML is essential towards web design, and in this unit I learned the basics of using HTML. Part of the process was being able to do a variety of things with HTML to improve my web pages.</p> 
    <p id="overview">Additionally, I had to participate in a group project where we had to create a video promoting CTE programs. Along the video, we created captioning as well as posted the video on our websites. This group project gave me a lot of experience on working with outside resources to help develop my website.</p>
    <p id="overview">Some informative things I learned this unit:</p>
    <ul id="stuff">
        <li>Root folder</li>
        <li>Captioning</li>

        <li>Absolute and relative links</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Unit 3</h2>
    <p id="overview">In this Unit, we went a little bit more in-depth with how CSS operates. To begin with, I worked with color and typography more in order to make my website more appealing to visitors. I learned the difference of classes and IDs and how to utilize them to make work easier. Additionally, I learned what the box model is and how useful it can be for web designers like myself.</p>
      <p>Here are the major things I learned this unit:</p>

      <li>Classes and IDs</li>
      <li>Page Layout Techniques</li>
      <li>The Box Model</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Unit 4</h2>
    <p id="overview">Unit Four mostly revolved around artwork and designing your website. For example, I worked with creating a banner and a background image for my website. Additionally, I added a photo album to my website to share to the public, as well as buttons that I created myself for visitors to utilize.</p>
        <p>Here are the major things I learned this unit:</p>
    <ul id="stuff">
      <li>How to create a button</li>

      <li>How to utilize graphic designing programs for web design</li>
      <li>The importance of dimensions and size in web designing</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Unit 5</h2>
    <p id="overview">Unit Five was an introduction to Javascript and how it is essential for both websites and web designers. As a way to introduce Javascript, we created a clocked powered by Javascript. After that, we used our CSS and HTML skills in order to put the clock on our website and design it.</p>
    <p>Here are the major things I learned this unit:</p>
        <ul id="stuff">
        <li>How Javascript impacts websites</li>
        <li>Some basics of Javascript</li>
        <li>How to create a clock using Javascript</li>
        <li>How you can use CSS and HTML for Javascript</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Unit 6</h2>
    <p id="overview">Unit Six introduced us to forms and surveys. The previous unit introduced us to Javascript, and for this unit we had to use what we learned and more to create a form for our website. Additionally, we had to validate our websites using resources on the Internet. This was a large help for me because it allowed me to see what errors I have on my website, despite how simple or complicated it is. After creating our forms, we had people from other classes test our website and see if we had any errors.</p>
        <p>Here are the major things I learned this unit:</p>
            <ul id="stuff">
                <li>Creating forms using Javascript</li>
                <li>Receiving criticism from others</li>
                <li>Validating websites</li>
                <li>Using Google Forms</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Unit 7</h2>
    <p id="overview">Unit Seven was short but essential for web developers. This unit introduced us to web hosting and web services. We learned how web hosting works and why it's important for web develoeprs to know this type of information especially when having clients.</p>
        <p>Here are the major things I learned this unit:</p>
            <ul id="stuff">
                <li>Different web services like GoDaddy, etc.</li>
