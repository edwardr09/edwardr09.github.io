        <h1>Usability Study</h1>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>I studied my own portfolio as my website. My target audience was other students from different classes. I had them browse the website and perform tasks with Javascript functions and see if there were any issues.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>My subjects completed their task easily with minimal problems. There was a problem with the navigation bar, but nothing that prevented them from not being able to do the task.</p>
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>I learned that there were some things in my website that I either forgot or realized were problems, etc. I think that this activity will help me and my website in the future.</p>
